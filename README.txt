HarvestMap displays resource nodes, chests and fishing spots on map,
compass and the 3d world. Whenever you harvest crafting materials,
lockpick a chest, fish at a fishing hole, this addon will save the
location and place a pin on your map, compass and in the 3d world.
So if you need a certain resource later, you can easily see the
locations where the resource spawns.
This addon does NOT come with any precollected data, this addon will
only display the locations you discovered yourself. However, you can
download data if you wish to. See the section "How to import data?"
further below.
