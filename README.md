HarvestMap by: Shinni
==========

HarvestMap (formerly known as EsoheadMarkers) displays harvest nodes and chests on map and compass.

Features:
* displays (discovered) harvest nodes and chests on map and compass
* compatible with all languages (French translation by Kalmeth and wookiefrag)
* filters for each pin type (chests + a pin type for every kind of harvest node)
* size and color settings for each pin type
* field of view and distance settings for the compass
* import your already discovered nodes from Esohead via the chat command /import

## Do I still need the Esohead addon? ##

The Esohead addon needs to be active for /import to work. After you imported your old data, you don't need Esohead anymore for this addon.  It would still be great if you continued to use Esohead and upload you data.
